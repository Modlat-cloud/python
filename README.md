# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator

This is a beginner-friendly **Python calculator** that can perform the four basic mathematical operations:  
**Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).**

---

## 🚀 Features
- Accepts two numbers as input.
- Supports the following operations:
  - ➕ Addition
  - ➖ Subtraction
  - ✖️ Multiplication
  - ➗ Division (with a check to avoid division by zero)
- Handles invalid operators gracefully.

---

## 📂 How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.  
   You can check by running:
   ```bash
   python --version
or

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 --version
Save the code in a file called calculator.py.

Run the program:

bash
Copy
Edit
python calculator.py
(or use python3 depending on your system).

🖥️ Example Run
mathematica
Copy
Edit
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): *
10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
⚠️ Error Handling
If the user tries dividing by zero, the program shows:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Error: Division by zero is not allowed!
If an invalid operator is entered, the program shows:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Invalid operation entered!
🎯 Learning Goal
This program is perfect for beginners who want to learn:

How to take user input in Python.

How to use if-elif-else conditions.

How to handle errors (like division by zero).

How to format output with f-strings.

Would you like me to also include a **"Future Improvements" section** in the README (like adding square root, exponentiation, or running in a loop until the user quits)?
